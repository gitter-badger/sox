#SOX

Stack Overflow Extras is a project that stemmed from the [Stack Overflow Optional Features (SOOF)](https://github.com/shu8/Stack-Overflow-Optional-Features) project. It has been written by [ᔕᖺᘎᕊ](https://stackexchange.com/users/4337810/) and [ᴉʞuǝ](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1454538/), has a new look, and features have been rewritten to be better!

The SOX userscript adds a bunch of **optional** features to all sites in the Stack Exchange network. These can be toggled on or off from an easy to use control panel (see screenshot below).

##Installation & Requirements

1. Install [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox), [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (for Chrome), or [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit) for Safari. These are userscript managers that *must* be installed in order for this to work, as the script relies on certain `GM_*` functions in order to save your settings!
2. Install the script. Clicking on 'install' below will make your userscript manager prompt you automatically to install it.

3. Go to any site in the Stack Exchange Network (eg. [Super User](http://superuser.com/) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)). You will automatically be asked to choose and save your settings. A toggle button (gears icon) will be added to your topbar where you can change these later on:

##Bugs and Feature Requests

Please post bugs and feature requests as issues on [Github](https://github.com/soscripted/sox), where we can track them easily and push updates quickly. Please **do not** post them as answers on Stack Apps -- they are much harder to manage!

##Changes

Please see the change log [at Stack Apps](http://stackapps.com/a/6358).

Note: This project has no relation to Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange; it is simply a userscript that enhances the sites!
